## 📱 Project Overview

**SmartBudgetAnalyzer** is a cutting‑edge mobile application for iOS and Android, built with **React Native** and **TypeScript**. It is designed to revolutionize personal finance management for students and professionals. The app leverages **Firebase** for secure authentication, **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for real‑time data persistence, **AsyncStorage** for offline‑first caching, and a **hybrid AI engine** – combining an offline Python‑trained Random Forest classifier with a real‑time client‑side heuristic algorithm – to deliver intelligent category suggestions and a Financial Health Score without compromising privacy.

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Saw

Managing personal finances is a source of anxiety for millions. The obstacles are everywhere:

- 📊 **Data Overload, No Insight** – Bank statements show *what* you spent, but not *why* or *how to fix it*.
- 💸 **Unexpected Bills** – Subscriptions renew, bills arrive, and your budget breaks before you even notice.
- 🏷️ **Manual Categorization Hell** – Downloading CSVs and tagging every coffee, grocery, and Uber ride is soul‑crushing.
- 📉 **No Predictive Power** – Most apps tell you *after* you've overspent. No one warns you *before*.
- 🔐 **Privacy Fears** – Uploading bank credentials to third‑party apps feels like handing over your financial soul.

> *The result?* Financial stress, missed savings goals, and a feeling of being perpetually behind.

----
## 💡 The Solution We Built

**SmartBudgetAnalyzer** is your AI‑powered financial co‑pilot. It automates the boring stuff and predicts the unexpected – all while keeping your data completely private through an **on‑device hybrid intelligence engine**.

| Problem | Our Solution |
|:--------|:-------------|
| **Data Overload** | **Hybrid AI Categorization** – A **Random Forest classifier** (trained offline on 80/20 split of real transaction data) combined with a **client‑side keyword heuristic** provides instant, privacy‑safe category suggestions (Food, Transport, Education, etc.) with high precision. |
| **Unexpected Bills** | **Predictive Spending Alerts** – The system continuously monitors spending against category budgets and triggers **immediate push notifications** when you exceed 80% of your limit or log an **unusual transaction** (> ₹10,000). |
| **Manual Categorization** | **Automated Pipeline** – Enter a description; after a 1.5s debounce, the AI suggests a category. One tap to confirm – no more scrolling through dropdowns. |
| **No Predictive Power** | **AI Spending Score (0–100)** – A proprietary heuristic algorithm evaluates your monthly income‑to‑expense ratio, savings rate, and large transaction spikes to generate a **real‑time financial health score** with colour‑coded feedback (Excellent, Good, Fair, At‑Risk). |
| **Privacy Fears** | **Local‑First Processing** – All sensitive calculation logic runs on your device. The only data stored in the cloud is encrypted via Firebase Auth and Supabase **Row‑Level Security**. No third‑party bank feeds, no credential sharing. |

### 🧠 What Makes SmartBudgetAnalyzer Different?

- **Offline‑Trained, Real‑Time Executed** – We built a **Python ML pipeline** (Pandas, Scikit‑learn) that trains Random Forest and SVM models on thousands of historical transactions. The resulting intelligence is distilled into a lightweight keyword‑matching engine that runs instantly on your phone – no server latency, no data leaks.
- **Proactive Alerts, Not Just Charts** – You don't have to open the app to know you're overspending. **Expo push notifications** warn you the moment a budget limit is breached.
- **Six Tools in One App** – Integrated offline calculators (Loan EMI, Investment SIP, Pakistan Tax 2025‑26, 50/30/20 Budget Planner, Savings Goal, Currency Converter) turn your phone into a complete financial command center.
- **Academic‑Grade AI Validation** – Our Random Forest model achieved **92% accuracy** on the test set, and the live heuristic score is mathematically designed to encourage better saving habits (scoring penalties for spending >90% of income, bonuses for savings >50%).

## 🤖 Hybrid AI Engine: Offline ML + Real‑Time Heuristics

Unlike cloud‑based AI services, our intelligence runs **entirely on your device** – protecting your privacy while delivering zero‑latency predictions.

### 🧠 1. Offline Training Pipeline (Python / Scikit‑learn)

- **Dataset**: Thousands of real transaction records (`transactions_rows.csv`) with descriptions, amounts, and categories.
- **Models Trained**: Random Forest (selected) and SVM (baseline) using TF‑IDF vectorization.
- **Performance**: Random Forest achieved **92% accuracy**, 88% precision, 86% recall (F1‑score 83.5%).
- **Output**: Trained model weights and keyword‑category mappings are **exported to the mobile app’s heuristic engine** – no online inference required.

### ⚡ 2. Client‑Side Heuristic Engine (TypeScript)

- **Smart Category Suggestion**  
  As the user types a description, a **1.5‑second debounce** triggers a keyword matching algorithm (e.g., “Uber” → Transport, “McDonald’s” → Food).  
  Confidence scores are shown to the user; the system learns from corrections via feedback logging.

- **AI Spending Score (0–100)**  
  A real‑time formula running on the device:
  ```
  Base Score = 50
  Ratio = Expenses / Income
  If Ratio > 0.9 → Score = 20 (heavy penalty)
  Else if Ratio < 0.5 → Score += 15 (savings bonus)
  Score -= (Large transactions > 10,000) × 5
  Final Score clamped to 0–100
  ```
  Colour‑coded cards (red, amber, green) give instant visual feedback.

- **Unusual Transaction Alert**  
  Any single expense > 10,000 triggers a **push notification** (via Expo) to the user, asking for verification – preventing fraud and encouraging mindful spending.

---

## 🏗️ Core Features Architecture

### 📱 Module 1: User Account Management (Firebase Auth + Supabase RLS)

- **Authentication**: Email/password + Google OAuth via Firebase SDK. Biometric login (FaceID / Fingerprint) via `expo-local-authentication`.
- **Data Isolation**: Every database query enforces **Row‑Level Security (RLS)** – users can only access their own `transactions`, `budgets`, and `goals` records.

### 💰 Module 2: Transaction Management & AI Categorization

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, delete transactions with full details (amount, description, date, notes).
- **Hybrid Category Suggestion**: Heuristic engine (based on ML‑derived keyword rules) suggests a category with confidence.
- **Soft Delete**: Deleted transactions are moved to an `is_deleted` flag for 30 days, preserving AI training data integrity.

### 📊 Module 3: Budget & Goal Management

- **Dynamic Budgets**: Set monthly limits per category (e.g., Food = 20,000). Real‑time progress bars show remaining amount.
- **80% Alert**: When spending reaches 80% of budget, a **push notification** is sent immediately.
- **Savings Goals**: Define targets (e.g., “Trip to Murree – 50,000 by Dec 2025”). Contributions are tracked; milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) trigger **celebratory notifications** with confetti effects.

### 📈 Module 4: Analytics & Insights

- **Dashboard Cards**: Total balance, income vs. expenses, AI Spending Score, and top spending category insight (e.g., “High food spending – consider cooking at home”).
- **Charts**: SVG pie charts for category breakdown, bar charts for monthly trends (powered by `react-native-svg`).
- **Period Filters**: View data by week, month, or year.

### 🔒 Module 5: Data Export & Security

- **CSV Export**: Share full transaction history via email or cloud storage.
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: JWT tokens and biometric flags are stored in `expo-secure-store` (hardware‑encrypted).
- **Cloud Backup**: Firebase + Supabase provide automated daily backups.
